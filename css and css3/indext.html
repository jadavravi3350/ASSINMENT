            <h3> Q.3 What is the difference between CSS2 and CSs3 ? </h3>

            <b> Ans : -</b>

            <br>

            <p>The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 has
                been
                split into different sections, called modules. Each of these
                modules
                is making its way through the W3C in various stages of the
                recommendation process.</p>

            <p>If you compare this process to what happened with CSS2, where
                everything was submitted as a single document with all the
                Cascading
                Style Sheets information within it, you begin to see the
                advantages
                of breaking the recommendation up into smaller, individual
                pieces.
                Because each of the modules is being worked on individually,
                developers enjoy a much wider range of browser support for CSS3
                modules.</p>

            <h3> Q.4 Name a few Css style components ? </h3>

            <b> Ans : -</b>

            <br>

            <p>The major components of a CSS style are as follows: Selecter:
                HTML
                element name, id name, class name. Property: It's like an
                attribute
                such as background
                color,font-size,position,text-align,color,border
                etc. Values: Which defines property or values allocate for
                properties.</p>

            <p> => Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target
            </p>
            <p> => Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for
                example
                border, color,background, position etc.</p>
            <p> => Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.</p>
            <p> => nline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and
                content, making everything more difficult to read and
                understand.
                Separating code and </p>
            <p> => There are five possible values of the position property. If
                an
                item is positioned in any way other than static , then the
                further
                properties top , bottom </p>

            <h3> Q.5 What do tou understand by Css opacity ? </h3>

            <b> Ans : -</b>

            <br>

            <p>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity
                is
                the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is
                the
                opposite of transparency . </p>

            <p>opacity applies to the element as a whole, including its
                contents,
                even though the value is not inherited by child elements. Thus,
                the
                element and its children all have the same opacity relative to
                the
                element's background, even if they have different opacities
                relative
                to one another.</p>

            <h3> Q.6 How can the background color of an element by chenged ?
            </h3>

            <b> Ans : -</b>

            <br>

            <p>To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color
                property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it
                inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an
                HTML
                element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</p>

            <p>In HTML and CSS, background color is denoted by the
                background-color
                property. To add or change background color in HTML, simply add
                inline CSS to your code.

                <h3> Q.7 How can image repetition of the backup be controlled ?
                </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat
                    property
                    that will help us to control the repetition of the image.</p>
                <p>The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the
                    background image both horizontally and vertically. It also
                    decides whether the background image will be repeated or
                    not.</p>

                <h3> Q.8 What is the use of the background-position property ?
                </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>background-position property ka use ham background img ko set
                    karne ke liye karte he usme ham x-axix and y-axix ke aadar
                    par
                    uska use karte hai background-position charo side se de
                    sakte
                    hai </p>

                <p>The background-position property sets the starting position
                    of a
                    background image</p>

                <p> A position defines an x/y coordinate, to place an item
                    relative
                    to the edges of an element's box. It can be defined using
                    one to
                    four values. If two non-keyword values are used, the first
                    value
                    represents the horizontal position and the second represents
                    the
                    vertical position. If only one value is specified, the
                    second
                    value is assumed to be center. If three or four values are
                    used,
                    the length-percentage values are offsets for the preceding
                    keyword value.</p>

                <h3> Q.9 Which property controls the image scroll in the
                    background
                    ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>The most usely property of the scroll in the background is
                    the
                    background-position fixed . </p>

                <p>background-position fixed se app usko scroll par work karva
                    sakte
                    hai . </p>

                <p>The background-attachment property specifies whether the
                    background image will scroll along with the rest of the
                    elements
                    on the page when the user slides the scroll-bar in the
                    browser
                    or whether the image will stay fixed to the page. The
                    background-attachment property can either be set to scroll
                    or
                    fixed . </p>

                <h3> Q.10 Why should background and color be used as separate
                    properties ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>Why background and color are the separate properties if they
                    should always be set together? The background property is a
                    complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color,
                    the
                    complexity will further increase . </p>

                <p>Color is an inherited property while the background is not.
                    So
                    this can make confusion further . </p>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web
                    Consortium . </p>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used
                    for
                    describing the presentation of a document written in a
                    markup
                    language such as HTML or XML . </p>
                <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible
                    to

                    different
                    rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
                    (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
                    tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
                    if
                    the content is accessed on a mobile device . </p>

                <h3> Q.13 What are the ways to inregrate CSS as a web page ?
                </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a
                    single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style
                    attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML
                    document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also
                    connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS
                    from
                    our HTML . </p>

                <p>three way's to create a inregrate css of the first is inline
                    css,second is internal css and the thired and last is
                    external
                    css you can creat any website of the thired Css . </p>

                    koi bhi font-family add karva sakte he </p>

                <p> CSS stylesheets can be applied to an HTML document in 3 ways
                    –
                    inline styles, embedded stylesheet, and external stylesheet.</p>

                <h3> Q.15 What are the external style sheets ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be
                    accessed by creating a link within the head section of the
                    webpage. </p>

                <p>Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the
                    stylesheet. </p>

                <p> The link to an external style sheet is placed within the
                    head
                    section of the page.</p>

                <p>one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages .
                </p>

                <p>you can create classes of styles that can then be used on
                    many
                    different HTML elements . </p>

                <h3> Q.16 What are te advantages and disadvantages of using
                    external
                    style sheets ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p><b>ADVANTAGE :</b> <br> The main advantage of external
                    styling is
                    that, when it is linked to by every page, it ensures all
                    pages
                    are uniform in look and style creating a cohesive website.
                    It
                    also allows you to focus on the other aspects of web design
                    when
                    creating the other pages as you don’t need to worry about
                    the
                    styling as that is already done thanks to the external file.
                    Additionally, it keeps your other pages code nice and tidy
                    as
                    all the styling, which can often entail a lot of code, is
                    separated onto a completely different file.</p>

                <p><b>DISADVANTAGE :</b> <br> The main disadvantage of external
                    CSS
                    is that it does not allow for more specific controlling of
                    certain elements so, if you were to only use external
                    styling,
                    every single version of the same element would look exactly
                    the
                    same. To combat this you could use internal styling, in-line
                    styling or both in addition to external. Additionally, the
                    CSS
                    file must be referenced by every page of the site, if it is
                    not,
                    none of the formatting it sets out will be applied.
                </p>

                <h3> Q.17 What is the meaning of the CSS selector ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a
                    pattern
                    of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML
                    elements should be selected to have the CSS property values
                    inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements
                    which
                    are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject
                    of
                    the selector . </p>

                <p>In other articles you may have met some different selectors,
                    and
                    learned that there are selectors that target the document in
                    different ways — for example by selecting an element such as
                    h1,
                    or a class such as special . </p>

                <p>If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then
                    the
                    individual selectors can be combined into a selector list so
                    that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors
                    .

                <h3> Q.18 What are the media types allowed by CSS ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>One of the most important features of style sheets is that
                    they
                    specify how a document is to be presented on different
                    media: on
                    the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a
                    braille
                    device, etc . </p>

                <p>Specify the target medium within the document language.</p>

                <p>Some CSS properties are only designed for certain media. For
                    example, the page-break-after property only applies to paged
                    media. However there are several properties that may be
                    shared
                    by different media types, but may require different values
                    for
                    that property. The font-size property for example can be
                    used
                    for both screen and print media, but possibly with different
                    values.</p>

                <p>A document usually needs a larger font on a computer screen
                    as
                    compared to the paper for better readability, also
                    sans-serif
                    fonts are considered easier to read on the screen, while
                    serif
                    fonts are popular for printing. Therefore it is necessary to
                    specify that a style sheet, or a set of style rules, applies
                    to
                    certain media types.</p>

                <h3> Q.19 What is the rule set ? </h3>

                <b> Ans : -</b>

                <br>

                <p>A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more
                    declarations.</p>

                <p>The selector which in this example is h1 points to an HTML
                    element.</p>

                <p>The declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and
                    text-align: center style the element with a property and
                    value.</p>

                <p>The key is property name & the value is property value, both
                    the
                    key and values are case-insensitive by default in CSS.</p>

                <p>The portion in which the curly braces & the properties are
                    declared is declaration block.</p>

                <p>The complete declaration is a ruleset.</p>
